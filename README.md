on Second button :

Create a straight forward logic that utilizes a recursive function to determine the Fibonacci value at a specified position. Ensuring  performance at scale, allowing it to handle larger numbers without experiencing exponential slowdown. When dealing with substantial numbers where the Fibonacci value becomes excessively large, the application should display an infinity sign instead.
